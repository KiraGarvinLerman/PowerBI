# PowerBI Projects Repository

Welcome to my PowerBI Projects Repository. This repository contains PowerBI projects that showcase various data visualization and analysis techniques using PowerQuery, DAX, and other PowerBI features.

## Viewing 

You can view the files in two ways.

1. **PDF:** Each project will have a PDF export. This will give you a sense of the overall look and approach, but will not be a live dashboard.
2. **PBIX:** You can download and view the PBIX file within PowerBI Desktop. Please ensure your version of PowerBI Desktop is up to date.
