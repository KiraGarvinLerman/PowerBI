# Bike Sales Analysis Project

Welcome to the Bike Sales Analysis Project! This project started with an uncleaned data table about bike sales sourced from Kaggle. The data was then cleaned and broken into tables using PowerQuery, and subsequently analyzed and visualized within PowerBI.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a PowerBI project that demonstrates the process of transforming raw data into meaningful insights. The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: The initial dataset from Kaggle was uncleaned and required significant preprocessing. Using PowerQuery, the data was cleaned to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and standardize formats.

2. **Data Transformation**: After cleaning, the data was broken down into multiple tables to facilitate easier analysis. PowerQuery was used to create relationships between these tables and to perform necessary transformations.

3. **Data Analysis**: With the cleaned and transformed data, various analyses were conducted. This included using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), to create measures and calculated columns that provide deeper insights into the bike sales data.

4. **Data Visualization**: The final step involved creating interactive visualizations in PowerBI to present the findings. These visualizations include charts, graphs, and dashboards that allow users to explore the data and uncover trends and patterns. *Please note that this project was limited to personal account visualization options.*

## Viewing 

You can view the files in two ways.

1. **PDF:** This will give you a sense of the overall look and approach, but will not be a live dashboard.
2. **PBIX:** You can download and view the PBIX file within PowerBI Desktop. Please ensure your version of PowerBI Desktop is up to date.
